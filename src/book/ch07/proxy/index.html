  <h2>JavaScript Proxy Summary</h2>
  <p>The JavaScript Proxy object is a built-in feature that allows you to create a proxy for another object, which can intercept and redefine fundamental operations for that object. This enables adding extra functionality or controlling access without modifying the original object directly.</p>
  <h3>Pros:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Separation of concerns: The proxy can handle specific tasks independently from the subject.</li>
    <li>Easy to implement and extend functionality without altering the original subject.</li>
    <li>Can provide a level of security by controlling access to the subject.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>May introduce complexity due to the additional layer of abstraction.</li>
    <li>Can cause a decrease in performance, as the proxy may require additional processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Example Explanation:</h3>
  <p>In this example, the player can collect coins in a simple game. The Player object represents the player, and the Proxy object controls access to the Player object, keeping track of the player's score and applying a multiplier to increase the score based on certain conditions. We use the built-in JavaScript Proxy object to add extra functionality without altering the original Player object.</p>
