    <h3>Summary of Builder Pattern</h3>
    <p>
        The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its
        representation. This allows for the creation of different representations using the same construction process.
        The pattern is especially useful when dealing with objects that have many optional or required parameters.
    </p>
    <h4>Pros:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Separates construction from representation</li>
        <li>Allows for the creation of different representations</li>
        <li>Improves code readability and maintainability</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cons:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>May introduce unnecessary complexity for simple objects</li>
        <li>Requires more code to set up</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In this example, the Builder pattern is used to create a Pizza and a Burger. The pattern allows for the
        construction of the Pizza and Burger objects using the same process, while keeping the details of the
        representation separate.
    </p>

        We have a `FastFoodBuilder` class with empty methods that act as a blueprint for creating new builders. We then
        have two builders, `PizzaBuilder` and `BurgerBuilder`, that extend `FastFoodBuilder` and implement the methods
        to create a Pizza and a Burger, respectively.

        The `FastFoodDirector` class is responsible for constructing the final object using the builder. The director
        takes a builder as an argument and calls the construction methods in the correct order.
