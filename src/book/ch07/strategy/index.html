        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms,
            encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows you to switch between algorithms at
            runtime without affecting the calling code.</p>
        <p>Pros:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Improved code organization by separating the algorithms from the code that uses them.</li>
            <li>Easy to add new strategies without modifying the calling code.</li>
            <li>Promotes the Open/Closed Principle, as the calling code is open for extension but closed for
                modification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Increases the number of classes and objects in the system.</li>
            <li>Clients must be aware of different strategies and their trade-offs.</li>
            <li>Can be overkill for simple use cases.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This example demonstrates the Strategy design pattern by implementing a simple game where a player can choose
            between different attack strategies to defeat an enemy. The attack strategies (SwordAttack, BowAttack, and
            MagicAttack) are encapsulated and interchangeable, allowing the player to switch between them at runtime
            without affecting the calling code.</p>
